# AutoChickenCoopDoor
Python program for opening and closing a chicken coop door using a raspberry pi.

This is a program in progress for opening and closing a chicken coop door remotely using a raspberry pi with a wireless connection.
It is powered by a solar charged battery running the raspberry pi outputting to a relay switch, which 
powers on an actuator that opens and closes the coop

You can open/close the coop door manually by selecting open/close buttons, or if you choose you can set the time of day you want the coop to automattically open and close.

Future improvements will be to add a function to allow the user to set the coop to open at sunrise and close at sundown.
