# AutoChickenCoopDoor
Python program for opening and closing a chicken coop door using a raspberry pi.

This is a program in progress for opening and closing a chicken coop door remotely using a raspberry pi with a wireless connection.
It is powered by a solar charged battery running the raspberry pi outputting to a relay switch, which 
powers on an actuator that opens and closes the coop.

Currently this is done manually by selecting an open or close button from the program, 
goal is to give the user options to use either manual select buttons or set a timer to open and close at certain 
times of the day with an open and close button override.

## Future improvements will be to add a photocell and give the option to open and close the coop on sun up or sun down.
